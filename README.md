# Dashboard Template

This is a ready-to-use dashboard template built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) as its design foundation. It provides a solid starting point to quickly set up your dashboard projects.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
